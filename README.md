arduLight
=========
Welcome to ArduLight!  This is a little project I worked on a while ago, it implements control of various things attached to an Arduino via an iPhone and basic networking sockets.  The Arudino has an Arduino brand WiFi shield attached for communication.  As of now, the iPhone app sends messages only when the user releases his/her finger from the screen.
